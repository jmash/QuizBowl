# QUIZ BOWL!

### A Quick Example for a Student

This was created because a student I tutor showed me a Java project he was working on. It was a quiz game, and he
had built it up as a long series of nested conditionals spanning almost 700 lines. I explained the concept of modularity,
but I'm not sure it was a very effective explanation. I didn't know any Java but I still wanted to show him what
I meant. So, I learned some Java. Hopefully this gets the idea across.
